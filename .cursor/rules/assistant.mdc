Build a repository with TypeScript that includes:

1. **Backend Service**: A service responsible for scraping my bank data including:
   - Transactions
   - Trends
   - Incomes
   - Expenses
   
   Use https://github.com/eshaham/israeli-bank-scrapers for the scraping functionality (I'm in Israel using Bank Leumi).

2. **MCP Server**: Implement a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that exposes the bank data scraping functionality as tools that can be consumed by AI assistants.

The final repository should contain both the backend service for data scraping and the MCP server implementation as the end result.
