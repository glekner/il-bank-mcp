## What is IL Bank MCP?

IL Bank MCP is a finance assistant that brings your Israeli bank data to any AI assistant. It combines a headless scraper (powered by [`israeli-bank-scrapers`](https://github.com/eshaham/israeli-bank-scrapers)) with an MCP server, letting LLMs analyze your transactions, track spending patterns, and provide financial insights.

### How to use IL Bank MCP?

Run it with Docker Compose for the quickest setup:

```bash

  docker compose up -d
```

Then add it to your AI assistant. For Raycast, use their MCP extension with:

```

        "run",
        "--rm",
        "-i",
        "mcp-server"
      ],
      "env": {
        "LEUMI_USERNAME": "your_username",
